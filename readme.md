#UE4 Spotify API Client

This Repository is a (currently WIP) Client for using the Spotify API

In previous versions it allowed for getting the currently playing track aswell as skipping / pausing playback. 

Same functionality is being worked on right now however this version works different. It uses threading to get things done in the background.
